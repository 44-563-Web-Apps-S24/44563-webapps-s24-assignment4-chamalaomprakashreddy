    <h1>Omprakash Reddy Chamala does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h6>THE THREE SISTERS Act 4 Author: Anton Chekov</h6>
    
<h3>TUZENBACH.</h3> <p>[Exchanges kisses with FEDOTIK] You're a good sort, we got on
    so well together. [Exchanges kisses with RODE] Once again.... Good-bye,
    old man!</p> <br>

<h3>IRINA.</h3><p> Au revoir!</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3> <p>It isn't au revoir, it's good-bye; we'll never meet again!</p><br>

<h3>KULIGIN.</h3> <p>Who knows! [Wipes his eyes; smiles] Here I've started crying!</p><br>

<h3>IRINA.</h3> <p>We'll meet again sometime.</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3> <p>After ten years--or fifteen? We'll hardly know one another
    then; we'll say, "How do you do?" coldly.... [Takes a snapshot] Keep
    still.... Once more, for the last time.</p><br>

<h3>RODE.</h3> <p>[Embracing TUZENBACH] We shan't meet again.... [Kisses IRINA'S
    hand] Thank you for everything, for everything!</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3> <p>[Grieved] Don't be in such a hurry!</p><br>

<h3>TUZENBACH.</h3> <p>We shall meet again, if God wills it. Write to us. Be sure to
    write.</p><br>

<h3>RODE.</h3> <p>[Looking round the garden] Good-bye, trees! [Shouts] Yo-ho!
    [Pause] Good-bye, echo!</p><br>

<h3>KULIGIN.</h3> <p>Best wishes. Go and get yourselves wives there in Poland....
    Your Polish wife will clasp you and call you "kochanku!" [Note:
    Darling.] [Laughs.]</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3> <p>[Looking at the time] There's less than an hour left. Soleni
    is the only one of our battery who is going on the barge; the rest of
    us are going with the main body. Three batteries are leaving to-day,
    another three to-morrow and then the town will be quiet and peaceful.</p><br>

<h3>TUZENBACH.</h3> <p>And terribly dull.</p><br>

<h3>RODE.</h3> <p>And where is Maria Sergeyevna?</p><br>

<h3>KULIGIN.</h3> <p>Masha is in the garden.</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3><p> We'd like to say good-bye to her.</p><br>

<h3>RODE.</h3> <p>Good-bye, I must go, or else I'll start weeping.... [Quickly
    embraces KULIGIN and TUZENBACH, and kisses IRINA'S hand] We've been so
    happy here....</p><br>

<h3>FEDOTIK.</h3><p> [To KULIGIN] Here's a keepsake for you... a note-book with a
    pencil.... We'll go to the river from here.... [They go aside and both
    look round.]</p><br>

<h3>RODE.</h3> <p>[Shouts] Yo-ho!</p><br>

<h3>KULIGIN.</h3> <p>[Shouts] Good-bye!</p><br>
